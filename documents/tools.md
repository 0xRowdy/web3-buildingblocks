# Tools

Below you'll find a list of tools that will support or supplement blockchain development

### JS Librarys

- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) - Quickly fire up a personal Ethereum blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) - The new kid on the block. Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software. It helps developers manage and automate the recurring tasks that are inherent to the process of building smart contracts and dApps, as well as easily introducing more functionality around this workflow.

### Smart Contract Librarys

- [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) - OpenZeppelin provides security products to build, automate, and operate decentralized applications. We also protect leading organizations by performing security audits on their systems and products.
- [Solmate](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate) - Open Source alternative of Open Zeplin.

### Testing

- [Mocha Testing Framework](https://mochajs.org/) - Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
- [Chai Assertion Library](https://www.chaijs.com/) - Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) - Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust and consists of:
  - [Forge:](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
  - [Cast:](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/cast) Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
  - [Anvil:](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/anvil) local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.

### RPC and Dev Tooling

- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) - Alchemy Web3 is a drop-in replacement for web3.js, built and configured to work seamlessly with Alchemy and provide multiple advantages such as automatic retries and robust WebSocket support.
- [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) - Our suite of high availability APIs and Developer Tools provide quick, reliable access to the Ethereum and IPFS networks so you can focus on building and scaling next generation software.
- [Moralis](https://moralis.io/) - Moralis provides managed backend for blockchain projects. Automatically syncing the balances of your users into the database, allowing you to set up on-chain alerts, watch smart contract events, build indexes, and so much more.
- [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) - The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible.

### Decentralized File Storage

- [IPFS](https://www.ipfs.com/) - IPFS (Interplanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge by making the web upgradeable, resilient, and more open.
- [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) - Arweave is a new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments, allowing users and developers to truly store data forever – for the very first time.
