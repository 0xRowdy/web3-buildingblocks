# Testing

Smart contracts are by nature immutable thus thorough testing is very important.

- [Mocha Testing Framework](https://mochajs.org/) - Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
- [Chai Assertion Library](https://www.chaijs.com/) - Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) - Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust and consists of:
  - [Forge:](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/forge) Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
  - [Cast:](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/cast) Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
